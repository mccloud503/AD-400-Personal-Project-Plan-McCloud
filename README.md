# AD-400-Personal-Project-Plan-McCloud

## Executive Summary

This project involves planning and executing a two-week trip to Romania with my boyfriend, including a 3-day stop in Paris to visit his cousin. This trip is meaningful because my boyfriend is Romanian and wants to introduce me to his family and culture — his grandparents currently live in Romania, and it’s important to him that I meet them. I’ve never been to Europe before, so this will be my first experience abroad. Our goal is to create a thoughtful plan that balances family visits, cultural sightseeing, and downtime so that we can enjoy this special opportunity together.

- Complete itinerary with travel details, activities, and family visits one month before departure.

- Pack and finalize logistics one week before leaving.
